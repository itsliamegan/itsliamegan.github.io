					<h2>Deconstruction is (not) Justice:</h2>
					<h3>The Injunction Towards the Other in Derrida’s Grammatology</h3>
				</header>
				<section>
					<h4>I. Introduction</h4>
					<p>
						In what follows, I will examine the relationship between the notions of ‘deconstruction,’ ambiguously-defined and inaugurated largely by Jacques Derrida’s <i>Of Grammatology</i>, and that of ‘justice.’  I ultimately aim to demonstrate that deconstruction, taken as a methodological commitment, contains an injunction towards justice, but not an obligation to it, and thus demands a constant, reflexive reworking to contain such an obligation. In the section, “The Grammatology, Deconstruction, and Justice,” I will begin by describing what deconstruction is, situating it within its initial literary-interpretive and philosophical contexts in the <i>Grammatology</i>. I will then consider the suggestion by Simon Critchley that deconstruction involves a commitment to the unapproachable otherness of the other, which Derrida equates with justice, suggesting that deconstruction and justice are coimplicated. In the section “Deconstruction’s Autoimmunity,” I will then examine the criticisms of this equivocation offered by Fred Evans and Terry Eagleton, who suppose, respectively, that deconstruction commits itself to its own opposition and possible undoing and that this commitment ultimately implies that there can be no movement beyond what deconstructions targets for its undoing. Additionally, in this section, I will offer some ways in which Derrida and Critchley might respond to such criticisms. Finally, in the section “Negotiating a Just Deconstruction,” I will evaluate each of the respective claims.

					<h4>II. The Grammatology, Deconstruction, and Justice</h4>
					<p>
						In 1967, Derrida simultaneously published three works: <i>Writing and Difference</i>, <i>Speech and Phenomena</i>, and <i>Of Grammatology</i>. While the first merely collects several of his essays written and lectures given up to that point, the other two focus on readings of particular authors. <i>Speech and Phenomena</i> concerns Husserl and the relevance in his work of the concept of the ‘sign,’ while <i>Of Grammatology</i> largely discusses Rousseau and his “Essay on the Origin of Languages.” In each of these works, Derrida employs a novel interpretive strategy, pitting a text against itself so as to discover the moments where it turns on itself, the brief revelations of contradictions, and the crossroads which result in unresolvable aporiae. Through several hundred pages of textual analysis, psycho-biographical investigation, and contextual situating, Derrida produces a reading of Rousseau in which the text ultimately says exactly the opposite of what it appears to be saying.
					</p>
					<p>
						This interpretive style defines the character of most of Derrida’s work, especially the early writings. The essay “Signature Event Context” provides a reading of J. L. Austin’s theory of speech acts which inverts Austin’s suggested relationship between normal and abnormal use of language, while the lecture “Structure Sign and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences” proposes that Claude Levi-Strauss’ secondary notion of bricolage is all that language can ever be capable of. Inverted readings thus form the early foundations of Derrida’s philosophical project. To read, to interpret, and to write about this reading/interpreting, for Derrida, is almost always to perform these kinds of inversions. Such an interpretive style, throughout the volumes published in 1967, is passingly referred to by the term ‘deconstruction.’ Though Derrida will repeatedly insist, in the following decades, that “deconstruction is not a method” (Derrida 2004, 155), deconstruction becomes taken up, in the literary as well as the philosophical spheres, as something of a method. The <i>Grammatology</i>, regardless of Derrida’s later claims, can be understood to provide both a blueprint and a justification for what becomes the ‘deconstructive project.’ I will thus begin by explicating—to the most reasonable possible extent—what deconstruction is, and to what it responds, in order to provide a foundation for any potential relationship to be drawn between it and justice.
					</p>
					<p>
						Deconstruction most fundamentally operates on the supposition that, no matter the strategy, the interpretation of a text can never work towards, nor finally achieve, the identification of any definite meaning within it. A text always, rather, gives a range of possible interpretations, the boundaries of which are unstable and in flux. The task of interpretation, qua deconstruction, is to try to read in accordance neither with the author’s intentions, nor the apparent logic of the text even detached from such intentions, but rather to produce a “signifying structure” which remains hidden within the text itself (Derrida 1974, 158). For Derrida, every author is always working within language, within a certain cultural and linguistic context, is “inscribed in a determined textual system” (Derrida 1974, 160). Thus, deconstruction seeks to piece together this signifying structure from the relationship “between what [the writer] commands and what he does not command of the patterns of the language that he uses” (Derrida 1974, 158). Yet, as stated earlier, deconstruction simultaneously supposes that this act of seeking can never finally find its object. Every writer, whether explicitly orienting themselves towards textual interpretation or not, strikes out to write something new only “in terms of the accepted oppositions,” (Derrida 1974, 162) i.e. within their current conceptual scheme, and dependent on it in order to criticize it. A textual interpretation, even one declaring itself deconstructive, can only ever perform its operation of those concepts which it has at its disposal. According to Derrida, “there is nothing outside of the text” (Derrida 1974, 158; emphasis removed) because all that any philosopher, literary theorist, et al. ever operates on are their linguistico-cultural concepts which they have taken from all the texts which have come before them, and serve to define them. There is therefore, for Derrida, no way for an interpreter to ever fully approach a text and carve out some specific, singular meaning for it, nor, even if there were, any way for them to write down this interpretation such that it itself could contain some singular meaning, because they are always already dependent on an infinite chain of all the texts before and around them.
					</p>
					<p>
						In terms of its attitude towards a text, then, deconstruction supposes that the text is a wholly other entity, and that this otherness can never truly be transgressed. It contains, claims Derrida, both an understanding that the other “is not something that can be detected and disclosed within a philosophical space” as well as a “positive response” to this otherness (Derrida 2004, 149), which affirms such a fundamental inability to transgress towards the other while nevertheless attempting it in futility. As John Caputo puts it, deconstruction is “organized around” the eventual “in-coming” of the other, the “event of the promise of something coming” (Caputo 1997, 42), believing that no matter how committed it is to seeking out the other in its determinacy, the thing sought always show itself to be the other at some future point. It is then from this commitment to otherness, to the unavoidability and eventuality of otherness, as well as to its fundamental unapproachability, that deconstruction’s ethical content will arise. Long after <i>Of Grammatology</i>, Derrida will make a forceful claim that “[d]econstruction is justice” (Derrida 1992, 15), and later that there is “no deconstruction without democracy, no democracy without deconstruction” (Derrida 1997, 105). I will return to Derrida’s claims in passing later, but with a desire to remain close to the <i>Grammatology</i> itself I will now turn to Simon Critchley’s <i>The Ethics of Deconstruction</i>. It is Critchley’s argument concerning the ethics inherent to the deconstructive act which I would like to consider.
					</p>
					<p>
						Critchley situates deconstruction’s ethical content as primarily emerging from what Derrida terms the ‘closure.’ Citing an early essay by Derrida on Emmanuel Levinas, Critchley characterizes Derrida’s concept of the closure as a point which is simultaneously concerned with the now and the future. The closure is the point at which what is present dominates one’s attitude of concern, while a distinctly different future, which has moved past such domination, is of equal interest (Critchley 1999, 20–21). It is at this point of closure that Critchley argues that deconstruction operates. He describes the method of deconstruction as a kind of ‘double reading,’ a chiasmus point between the text as it presents itself and the movement away from it which a deconstructive interpretation seeks to achieve (Critchley 1999, 28–29). Referring back to the <i>Grammatology</i>, Critchley illustrates that Derrida describes just this kind of double maneuver, where a ‘straightforward’ reading of a text—say, the text’s ‘standard’ interpretation—ought to be offered only insofar as a more ‘transgressive’ one can be. Such an act of double reading which constitutes deconstruction operates on the closure of the text at hand, because it is concerned both with what is being said and what is not, and cannot be. Critchley argues that this is the point at which deconstruction is, and becomes, ethical. The closure of a text is examined by deconstruction only insofar as it can both affirm the signifying structure of the text in its existence and yet acknowledge its fundamental lack of self-unity and dependence on a network of other texts and their signifying structures. Thus, for Critchley, deconstructively reading on the closure is an ethical maneuver because it recognizes the text in its otherness and at the same time feels unconditionally called to address the conceptual failures of this otherness,  even if it believes that its own operation cannot succeed (Critchley 1999, 30–32).
					</p>
					<p>
						One is thus led to understand why Derrida will later claim that deconstruction is justice, insofar as justice is construed—in a Levinasian manner, as both Derrida and Critchley will agree with—as an infinite, unconditional affirmation of the otherness of the other. Deconstruction supposes that the other, the text, is absolutely unapproachable and cannot even succeed at its own supposed goal of introducing a coherent, sensible, individual idea. At the same time, however, deconstruction feels unconditionally called to respond to this other, to illustrate the ways in which it can be understood to have both succeeded and failed at carving out a coherent area of definite meaning. Writing, deconstruction supposes, always operates with the possibility of miscommunication, but it feels compelled to illustrate this fact by way of writing nevertheless. This, according to Critchley, is why the event, the act, the methodological commitment, of deconstruction is coimplicative with that of justice, as the Levinasian justice that Derrida and Critchley bring into relevance depends on this fundamental commitment to the other which cannot be ignored.

					<h4>III. Deconstruction's Autoimmunity</h4>
					<p>
						For Derrida, the cultural context of the mid-twentieth century in which deconstruction emerges, and operates, depends on a series of equivocations. To caricature: speech is metaphysics is (phono)logocentrism is injustice is totalitarianism, while writing is justice is democracy. Thus, the critical literature with which I am about to engage specifically targets Derrida’s claims surrounding the mutual dependence between democracy and deconstruction. In order to compensate for this distinction, I will read this material ‘back onto’ deconstruction qua ethics, following the set of equivocations that Derrida himself makes. I will therefore draw an opposition between Derrida/Critchley and Evans/Eagleton in relation specifically to the ethical content of deconstruction itself, trying to leave aside the considerations about democracy specifically.
					</p>
					<p>
						Derrida develops, in some of his final lectures, the notion of ‘democracy to come,’ which suggests that democracy is only itself insofar as it always opens itself up to the necessity of being redone in the future (Derrida 2005). This notion suggests that, in order to uphold its commitment to representing the interests of its constituents, democracy must remain open to amending itself in the face of changes in the interests of those people who make it up. Reading this in relation to deconstruction, we could understand deconstruction as a commitment to ‘meaning to come,’ the insistence that a singular meaning of a text is only ever disclosed in some never-present future which always makes itself other to the present. This is, as Critchley framed it, meaning on the closure. As Critchley has argued, the search for this meaning, this commitment to the otherness of the text, is fundamental and unassailable. Deconstruction is always committed to the other. Yet, as Derrida claims about democracy, this commitment is always open to its own undoing. Democracy falls victim to its own autoimmunity (Derrida 2005, 34–36). The commitment to the other can always be undone, because one may end up being committed to an other who is not themselves committed to otherness in the same way. For democracy, this means that it can falter when confronted by totalitarianism, but for deconstruction this means that its ethical commitment to justice can falter when encountering an other who is not.
					</p>
					<p>
						Fred Evans, in “Derrida and the Autoimmunity of Democracy,” builds on this critical flaw in Derrida’s notion of democracy’s foundations, and thus on that in Critchley’s claims of deconstruction’s ethical equivalence. Though Derrida supposes that democracy will ultimately survive its autoimmunity, due to an attitude of reasonableness and openness towards potential futures, Evans claims instead that the true acceptance of the fact that commitment to the other opens oneself up to the subversion of this commitment will likely make one disinclined to make the commitment in the first place (Evans 2016, 308). Deconstruction, in contrast to Critchley’s suggestion that it contains a fundamental commitment to the other, would instead imply an eventual rejecting of the other, an undoing of their otherness and an attempt at transgressing the boundary which grounds deconstruction’s ethical commitment. Evans also implicitly disagrees with Derrida here, in the sense that he believes this boundary could fundamentally be crossed. The second criticism which Evans offers at the autoimmunity of democracy, thus at that of deconstruction, is against its unconditional, necessary status. Evans suggests that the commitment to the other, when it is undone, is not always undone by those who are committed to its commitments. Derrida’s characterization of autoimmunity suggests that the subversion of the commitment to the other is performed by those who have the commitments themselves, only so that they can undo them. Evans, on the other hand, suggests that when one undoes democracy—or in this case subverts the commitment to the other which makes up the ethical content of deconstruction—they in fact do not do so in its name (Evans 2016, 309). Thus, it is not that deconstruction is autoimmune, opening itself to always undo itself, but it is rather that the supposedly unconditional ethical call contained within deconstruction is ignored when it is subverted.
					</p>
					<p>
						Terry Eagleton, in “Marxism and Deconstruction,” furthers the implications of this point. He equates deconstruction with liberal democracy, as does Derrida, but rather than supposing this to be a positive or optimistic gateway to an always open future, he suggests that this means deconstruction contains no political goals of action whatsoever (Eagleton 1981, 487–488). Thus, deconstruction cannot actually make good on its promise of respecting the fundamental otherness of the other despite its claim to. Eagleton also makes Evans’ point that deconstruction demands, by its commitment to being overwhelmed and overpowered by otherness, an equivalent commitment to its own undoing (Eagleton 1981, 482–484). Deconstruction, for Eagleton, is the revisionist spirit of liberal democracy embedded in a theoretical discipline. It decries any overarching theory, any tenets of method, with the result that it either produces complete stagnation and hegemony of precisely what it seeks to criticize, or invites its overturning by something far worse. Following Eagleton’s line of reasoning, a deconstructive reading would never be able to escape the conceptual framework of the text which it attempts to deconstruct, and move beyond. It would always, accepting the absolute otherness of its’ target, cement the other’s domination.
					</p>
					<p>
						Derrida, in response to the kinds of claims about the criticality of autoimmunity which Evans offers, consistently asserts that democracy, and thus deconstruction, is able to survive its encounter with its own autoimmunity because of an attitude of openness. Democracy to come, therefore the ‘meaning to come’ which I have suggested is the equivalent in deconstruction, remains committed to doing the impossible and always open to the infinite futures which it introduces (Derrida 2005, 86–89). Deconstruction insists that future texts must overcome the conceptual systems of the texts which are immanent to it, yet simultaneously supposes that no writer can ever intentionally do so. It is with an attitude of openness and a recognition of the seeming impossibility of its task at hand that deconstruction is able to do anything at all.
					</p>
					<p>
						Critchley would also respond to Eagleton’s claim that deconstruction has no ethical content by reasserting the ethical nature of the commitment to the other. Even if it results in its own undoing or stagnation, or always ends up dominated by the otherness of the other, this would still constitute ethical implications, just not results from those implications. Critchley would further contend, in response to the arguments about autoimmunity, that operation on the closure contains within it the assumption that the target of interpretation can be moved beyond absolutely. Deconstruction can provide no a priori reason that the signifying structure of a given text or series of texts can be escaped, but if Critchley were to slightly contort the notion of the closure, he could suggest that it might operate with the knowledge that conceptual overturning have in fact occurred, or at the very least are occurring. Derrida makes this allusion at the beginning of the <i>Grammatology</i>.
					</p>

					<h4>IV. Negotiating a Just Deconstruction</h4>
					<p>
						Having established deconstruction as found in Derrida’s <i>Of Grammatology</i>, its ethical content as argued by Critchley’s <i>The Ethics of Deconstruction</i>, and the opposition to this ethical complication in Evans’ “Derrida and the Autoimmunity of Democracy” and Eagleton’s “Marxism and Deconstruction,” it is now possible to evaluate each of their claims in relation to one another. Critchley’s argument that ethics is contained within the very constitution of deconstruction is incredibly compelling. If one takes justice to mean—as do Derrida and Critchley, in their shared reliance on Levinas—an absolute commitment to the other, then one is inclined to believe that deconstruction absolutely has ethical content. Its most fundamental assumption is that a text is so wholly other, both from potential interpreters but also from itself, that it can never be completely approached, that the boundary between oneself and it can never truly be transgressed. This is an almost totalizing recognition of otherness, and would form the foundations of a strong commitment to ethics of a Levinasian type. If one is committed to the other in this all-encompassing way, as Derrida and deconstruction are, then they are effectively absolutely committed to the ethical implications which fall out of it. Further, Critchley is certainly correct about the ethical move inherent to the gesture of the ‘double reading.’ Derrida remarks time and time again that one ought not to, in engaging in a deconstructive reading, transgress completely outside the logic of the text. He does not argue, as Foucault or Deleuze might, that a text is merely a conceptual system which affords one the ability to make as they please. Rather, a double reading on the closure first attempts to mark out the text, the other, in the ways the text itself sees itself as a totality, and only then strikes outwards to illustrate the ways in which that totality comes undone. This is an ethical gesture of respect, one which affirms the text as an other and yet simultaneously affirms the writing of the interpreter as its own other to the text itself. Neither the text nor its interpretive reading are able to broach each other’s conceptual boundaries, and yet they remain necessarily interlinked. This is an incredibly clear illustration, again, of an ethical commitment to each self as necessarily an other to every other self, both contained and interconnected at the same time. Thus, deconstruction contains within it, to take a phrase and a claim which Derrida oft makes, an ‘injunction’ towards justice. This is the call of the other, the necessary acknowledgement that the other is an other that is to be respected in and of themselves, but also understood to be dependent on a network of further others.
					</p>
					<p>
						Yet, Evans and Eagleton raise important points about the eventuality of making good on such an injunction. If one receives a call, and if interpretation strikes out in response to it, it is reasonable to believe that it is incredibly demotivating if one has to accept that such an injunction can never finally be achieved in order to make good on it. The deconstructive project, or even an individual deconstructive endeavor, might simply falter on its own grounds before it has the chance to suffer from its autoimmunity. Surely though it would be conceptually impossible finally complete the task of deconstructive reading, to finally approach of the other of a text, but it would at the very least be possible to make progress. Yet, such progress is met at every step by negation, responded to at every point with demotivation. One is thus compelled to agree with Evans when he asks why one would even embark on the deconstructive project of democracy in the first place, given deconstruction’s characterization of it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Further, if this interpretive strategy which accepts and demands that neither it nor its target ever finally say something in particular is always dominated by the call from the other to which it claims it responds, then one is inclined to concur with Eagleton. His claim that deconstruction lets that which it seeks to criticize, or move past, dominate over it and ultimately enshrine itself appears accurate because if deconstruction is content to accept that it will never approach the other of a text, yet simultaneously insists it must engage in a ‘double reading’ which respects the contours of the original text before criticizing it, it will always already have ceded its ground to its target. Deconstruction’s injunction thus does not need to be upheld, despite the strength of such a call. There is, in some sense, neither an obligation nor a necessity to make good on the ethical system to which Critchley claims deconstruction gives rise.
					</p>
					<p>
						Therefore, Critchley is correct in his characterization of deconstruction as an ethically just act. It feels called by the other of a text to both respect it as an other and to explicate it in its otherness, understanding that this explication will, by deconstruction’s own definition, fail. It therefore contains an injunction, a call, towards justice. Yet, neither he nor Derrida are correct in the case of making good on this injunction. Evans and Eagleton are correct insofar as they suggest that deconstruction, and the systems which it claims to imply, cannot survive its own autoimmunity. It would either fail before it got started, or cement that which it wishes to escape from while claiming to do the opposite. Thus, deconstruction’s injunction towards justice contains no ultimate obligation to respect it.
					</p>

				<section>
					<h4>V. Conclusion</h4>
					<p>
						In what has preceded I have explored the relationship between deconstruction and justice. I began by considering Jacques Derrida’s <i>Of Grammatology</i> insofar as it relates a method of textual interpretation in which one conceives of a text as presenting a ‘signifying structure’ demanding to be put in a relation of dominance over the apparent logic which a straightforward reading of a text determines. I then examined Simon Critchley’s argument from The Ethics of Deconstruction which claims that deconstruction contains an unavoidable ethical commitment to the other, a commitment which Derrida will later claim is equivalent to that of justice. I then turned to Fred Evans’ and Terry Eagleton’s criticisms of these ethical claims, which suggest that deconstruction cannot be the same as justice because it both falls down upon its own principled commitments and, even then, does not contain within it any promise to the actualization of such commitments. Ultimately, I have attempted to demonstrate that deconstruction is not coimplicative with justice, but rather contains an injunction towards justice which does not command an obligation.
